# widget_testing_with_animation

It's a very basic widget testing with animated container

## Getting Started

This simple project will help us to learn an basic how to catch a widget and it's properties in the deferent states of it which we want to test or compare with the expect values. Here a simple animated container,the initial width is 100,height is 100,color is green and border radius is 0 but when it is clicked the value of width & height should be 200, the color changed to red and border radius should be 50. see the below screenshort.
thanks all of my loving flutter devs. Happy coding with dart......|
